## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Scaling Rural Healthcare with AI and LLMs** initiative at the **University of Washington**. The goal is to develop a **virtual healthcare** clinic leveraging AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve access to medical services in **rural Washington**.

## Location & Healthcare Focus
* Rural Area: Ferry County, Washington
* Target Healthcare Issue: Pediatrics
* User Groups: Rural patients, healthcare providers, community health workers

## Prototype Features
* âœ… AI-driven patient onboarding & triage
* âœ… Large Language Model integration for medical FAQs
* âœ… Virtual consultation & scheduling system
* âœ… User-friendly interface tailored for rural access

## Tech Stack
Frontend: [React.js / Next.js / Vue.js]
Backend: [Node.js / Flask / Django]
Database: [PostgreSQL / Firebase / MongoDB]
AI/LLM Models: [OpenAI API / Custom-trained LLMs]

**How to Run**

```

## User Research & Feedback
We conducted user research sessions with patient volunteers and rural healthcare providers to refine our prototype. Key feedback includes:
* ðŸ“Œ [Summarized insights from patient testing]
* ðŸ“Œ [Challenges faced & areas of improvement]
* ðŸ“Œ [Iterations made based on real-world feedback]

## LLM Prompt Library
This project utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-generated prompts for user research, prototype development, and hypothesis validation. Below is a library of key prompts used:

## Prompts for User Research
* "What are the biggest challenges rural healthcare providers face in [County] when delivering telemedicine services?"
* "How do rural patients prefer to interact with AI-powered healthcare tools?"
* "Generate a structured interview guide to assess the needs of rural healthcare providers in [County]."

## Prompts for Lovable Prototype Development
* "Design a conversational AI prompt that helps rural patients schedule a virtual consultation with minimal friction."
* "What UX improvements can be made to a virtual clinic for non-tech-savvy patients?"
* "Generate a step-by-step patient onboarding flow that reduces drop-off rates."

## Prompts for Hypothesis Validation
* "Given user research findings, what additional data is needed to validate the hypothesis that AI-powered clinics improve patient retention?"
* "Summarize key statistical methods to analyze the effectiveness of AI-based virtual clinics in rural areas."

## Prompts for AI-Driven Decision Support
* "Generate an AI-powered symptom checker prompt that follows HIPAA-compliant guidelines."
* "Design a chatbot prompt that educates diabetic patients about lifestyle management."
### How We Used These Prompts:
* ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuned LLM-generated insights to match real-world provider & patient needs
* ðŸ”¹ Iterated on prototype designs based on AI-assisted workflow recommendations
* ðŸ”¹ Validated hypothesis through AI-driven user feedback analysis
